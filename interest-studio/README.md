## About
*Problem Statement :* To find students with similar interests pertaining to subjects and co-curricular activities taught at our University.
**Problem Solution : **We propose a digital platform called Interest Studio that will be inclusive of all mainstream and co-curricular skills and it will have options for each and every visitor to create a profile on our platform and follow the skills of his choice. By following a particular skill set, he/she will get to know other people from our University who follow the same skill set. This way, he/she can diversify his/her interests and find new and smart people who can extend their help in existing projects, ideas or activities.

*How Interest Studio works:*
- If a student is interested in learning, let say dance fusion of two dance forms like Indo-Western dance. He/She can easily find a group of Indo-Western dancers on Facebook or any other social media platform but it will be difficult to ask each group member their location of living or university for further knowledge.
- To do so, one has to send a request to all members of that group and once they accept that one has to ask for details. After this all he might get in touch with a similar person, who is on the same level of knowledge.
InterestStudio can help them by only clicking three times.
  
- On the first page of our web-app we provide all main-stream and co-curricular fields that users can explore. 
  
-  When one selects a field, he/she will be lead to a page that shows all possible interests that can exist in that field and a search bar to find his favorite skill set.
 
-  After finding his preferred interest, one will be given a list of students that follow this interest and a search filter to find students from his university.

 And then, one can connect and start learning with three easy steps.
